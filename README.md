# What is Malwatch?

**Malwatch** is a **Cyber Threat Intelligence Knowledge Graph** that acts as a central brain for cybersecurity data. Unlike traditional threat dashboards or standalone TIPs, CTI-KG **connects vulnerabilities, adversaries, exploits, and detection rules into a unified graph**, and enhances it with **AI-driven analytics and automation**.

With malwatch, security teams can:

1. 🔗 **Aggregate and normalize threat data** from CVEs, IOCs, ATT&CK, dark web feeds, and exploits 
2. 🎯 **Correlate campaigns, TTPs, and adversary behaviors** across multiple sources
3. 🛡️ **Simulate attack paths** and visualize risk across the organization 
4. 🤖 **Automate alerts, SOAR playbooks, and remediation tickets** based on contextual intelligence 
5. 💬 **Query the graph naturally** using an NLP chatbot 
6. 🔒 **Share intelligence securely** via STIX/TAXII with trusted partners 
7. 📈 **Monitor, retrain, and improve** the system continuously based on user feedback and drift detection 

Think of Malwatch as a **virtual cybersecurity analyst** with a memory, reasoning skills, and automation capabilities: it can see the network, understand threats, and take action—providing **contextual insights and actionable recommendations** faster than manual processes.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Malwatch** is designed to consolidate, analyze, and operationalize threat intelligence into a **centralized platform**.  

### Motivation
Organizations face **overwhelming volumes of threat data** from structured sources (CVEs, ATT&CK, CAPEC, vulnerability scans) and unstructured sources (blogs, APT notes, leak sites). Security teams often struggle to correlate data, prioritize risks, and proactively mitigate attacks. CTI-KG addresses these challenges with **AI-enhanced intelligence and automation**, enabling faster, context-aware decisions.

### High-Level Goals
1. Integrate **structured and unstructured threat intelligence** into a unified database.  
2. Enable **context-aware risk scoring** and prioritization of vulnerabilities.  
3. Apply **AI-driven analytics** for anomaly detection, predictive scoring, and attack simulations.  
4. Provide **automation & orchestration** with SOAR-ready playbooks and alerting.  
5. Deliver **interactive visualization & dashboards** for decision support.  
6. Facilitate **collaboration and secure threat sharing** via STIX/TAXII and TIP integrations.

## 🧠 Malwatch Pipeline Phases
: Full Inputs & Outputs & The Inbetweens (INPUTS AND OUTPUTS OF EACH PHASE NEEDS TO BE REVISED REALLY HARD)

The following sections detail each phase of the **Malwatch Pipeline**, including **inputs, internal processing, outputs**, and how they **connect to other phases**. This aligns directly with the agenda outlined in the Table of Contents.




<details> 
  <summary>✅ Phase 1: Threat Data Acquisition and Ingestion</summary> 

### 🔁 Inputs:
- **NVD API keys** → Primary CVE feed for vulnerabilities (2002–present).  
- **MITRE ATT&CK & CAPEC repos** → TTPs, attack patterns, and adversary behaviors.  
- **ExploitDB archives** → Exploit proofs-of-concept (PoCs).  
- **Organization’s cloud/infrastructure credentials** → AWS, Azure, GCP asset inventories (EC2, S3, IAM roles, etc.).  
- **Vulnerability scanner (Nessus/Qualys) access** → Internal vulnerability scan results.  
- **Dark web & underground forums monitoring feeds (optional, compliance-dependent)** → Credentials, chatter, malware sales.  
- **Public YARA & Sigma repositories** → Rules for malware detection and log correlation.  
- **Threat intelligence sharing communities (MISP, AlienVault OTX, Open Threat Exchange)** → Extra IOC feeds.  
- **Exploit weaponization trackers (CISA KEV, Exploit Prediction Scoring System - EPSS)** → Real-world exploitation signals.  
- **Paste sites & leak hubs (Pastebin, GitHub gists, Telegram dumps)** → Stolen credentials, config leaks.  

---

### ⚙️ Inside (Collection & Ingestion):
- Fetch daily CVE updates via NVD API (including modified feeds for historical corrections).  
- Sync ATT&CK/CAPEC knowledge bases weekly to catch new/updated TTPs.  
- Scrape ExploitDB & GitHub repos for new PoCs.  
- Pull cloud asset inventories (AWS Config, Azure Resource Graph, GCP Cloud Asset Inventory).  
- Run vulnerability scans (Nessus/Qualys/Cloud-native scanners like AWS Inspector).  
- Ingest YARA/Sigma rules for threat detection mapping to logs/telemetry.  
- Collect leak/breach exposure data (credentials, API keys, tokens) from commercial + OSINT breach monitoring services.  
- Subscribe to exploit weaponization feeds (EPSS API, CISA KEV catalog).  
- Collect OSINT domain/IP blacklists (Abuse.ch, Spamhaus, PhishTank).  
- Apply deduplication & tagging at ingestion (marking each record with source + timestamp + confidence).  
- Store everything in raw data lake (Bronze layer) for replay and auditing.  

---

### 🏗️ Storage & Infra Blueprint:
- **CVE Data (NVD JSON feeds)** → Raw JSON in object store (S3, Azure Blob, HDFS). Indexed in Elasticsearch/OpenSearch for fast lookup.  
- **ATT&CK & CAPEC repos** → Version-controlled in Git + object storage. Synced into Graph DB (Neo4j/JanusGraph) during KG construction.  
- **ExploitDB & PoCs** → JSON/Markdown archives in S3/HDFS. Indexed in code search DB (Elasticsearch + embeddings for semantic search).  
- **Cloud asset inventories** → Stored in relational DB (Postgres/CloudSQL) for structured querying + mirrored in object store for historical snapshots.  
- **Vulnerability scanner outputs** → Stored in Postgres for structured joins with assets. Also exported to Parquet in S3 for analytics.  
- **IOCs (IPs/domains/hashes)** → Written into time-series DB (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, OpenSearch) for historical tracking & correlation.  
- **YARA/Sigma rules** → Stored in Git-based repo + object store for reproducibility. Loaded into SIEM / search engines for live use.  
- **Dark web / leaks** → Encrypted JSON in object store. Indexed in Elasticsearch for analyst search.  
- **Exploit weaponization feeds (EPSS/KEV)** → Cached in Postgres for fast scoring joins with CVEs.  
- **All raw feeds** → Land in Bronze (raw) layer of Medallion architecture (S3/HDFS + Delta Lake). ETL jobs promote to Silver (normalized) → Gold (curated/KG).  

---

### 🔄 Pipeline Orchestration & Automation:
- **Workflow Orchestration:**  
  - Use Apache Airflow or Prefect for DAG scheduling (daily CVEs, weekly ATT&CK syncs, hourly IOC updates).  
  - Each source mapped to a DAG task with retries + backoff (e.g., NVD API → retry up to 3x with exponential delay).  

- **Streaming & Event Handling:**  
  - Use Kafka (or AWS Kinesis / GCP PubSub) for real-time feeds (dark web leaks, IOC streams, scanner deltas).  
  - Producers: Scrapers & API collectors.  
  - Consumers: Storage writers (object store, DB, search index).  

- **Data Flow:**  
  1. Fetch → APIs, scrapers, scanners.  
  2. Queue → Kafka topic (e.g., `cves.raw`, `iocs.raw`, `cloud.assets`).  
  3. Transform → Lightweight parsing & tagging.  
  4. Store → Write to raw Bronze layer (object store / DB).  
  5. Index → Push structured fields to Elasticsearch/Neo4j/timeseries DB.  

- **Monitoring & Observability:**  
  - Metrics pushed to Prometheus/Grafana (data freshness, ingestion lag, failed jobs).  
  - Logs centralized in ELK / OpenSearch.  
  - Alerts on data staleness (e.g., “No CVE updates in 24h”).  

- **Resilience:**  
  - Dead-letter queues (DLQ) in Kafka for bad events.  
  - Retry policies for transient failures (e.g., 404/500 from feeds).  
  - Backpressure handling to avoid DB overload.
